-- Storage Policies for Receipts Bucket
-- This creates the exact policies needed for receipt uploads

-- First, drop any existing policies on storage.objects for the receipts bucket

-- Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to upload receipts to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Allow upload to receipts" ON storage.objects

-- Policy 3: Allow users to update their own receipts
CREATE POLICY "Allow update own receipts" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (

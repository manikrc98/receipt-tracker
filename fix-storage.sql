-- Fix Supabase Storage Configuration
-- This will resolve the 400 error when uploading files

-- Step 1: Check if the receipts bucket exists
SELECT 'Checking receipts bucket:' as info;
SELECT 
  name,
  public,
  file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types,
  created_at
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE name = 'receipts';

-- Step 2: Create the receipts bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'receipts',
  'receipts',
  true,
  52428800, -- 50MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp', 'image/heic']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 3: Create storage policies for the receipts bucket
-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload receipts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own receipts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own receipts" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own receipts" ON storage.objects;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload receipts" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'receipts' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own receipts" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'receipts' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own receipts" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'receipts' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own receipts" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'receipts' AND 
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Step 4: Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 5: Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON storage.objects TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON storage.buckets TO anon, authenticated;

-- Step 6: Verify the setup
SELECT 'Storage setup verification:' as info;
SELECT 
  name,
  public,
  file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE name = 'receipts';

SELECT 'Storage policies:' as info;
SELECT 
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';

SELECT 'âœ… Storage configuration completed!' as status;
